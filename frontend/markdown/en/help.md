# Registering new users

It is not possible for administrators to register new users on this page. Users need to visit the page and log in. After doing this, they will become visible in the "Edit administrators" and "Edit groupleaders" submenus in the "ADMIN" menu.

# Role descriptions

## Administrator

Administrators gain access to a menu called "ADMIN". Administrators are able to appoint users to new roles, either as a new administrator or as a group leader. They are also able to choose what catalog is active, as well as to edit or create new catalogs. This can be done in the "Edit catalogs" submenu. Administrators are not able to view the answers of other individuals on this page, but have the opportunity to download an Excel report containing the answers. This can be done in the "Download catalogs" submenu. Administrators can also edit groups in the "Edit groups" submenu. Additionally, administrators are able to anonymize users in the "Anonymize users" submenu. Anonymization is a non-reversible action that is typically performed after an employee quits. The result of an anonymization is that the answers of a former employee is no longer associated with the person.

## Group leader

Group leaders gain access to a menu called "MY GROUP". This page lists all members of the group, along with a button to add new members. The group leader can click on names in the list to view the employees' answers.

## Deleting categories and questions

If you want to delete a category, you need to delete all its questions first. Additionally, deletion should probably happen before users have begun answering the catalog.
