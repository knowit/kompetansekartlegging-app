# kompetansekartlegging-app

This is an internal project for Knowit. The project aims
to create a tool to gauge the employees' skills and motivations
through a web form, and to make the analyses based on the form
available for the individual employees and managers.

## Dependencies

This project requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). It also requires that [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) are installed.
All custom scripts are written in bash script.

## Using AWS CLI SSO profiles

To use an AWS CLI sso profile, you need to run the sync_sso.py script before running our npm commands for deploying the backend. This script requires you to have boto3 installed on the python environment you use.
`python sync_sso.py awscliprofilename` is the full command you need to run. This creates temporary credentials for the SSO profile, allowing npm run deploy to use those to perform calls to AWS.

## Running the project

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the GitHub repo.
2. Run `$ cd kompetansekartlegging-app` (or whatever you've chosen to
   name the project in the cloning process)
3. Run `$ ./install.sh`
4. Run `cd cdk`
5. Configure AWS CLI credentials:
   - If you are using AWS SSO profiles you need to run `python sync_sso.py aws-cli-profile`
   - If not, run `aws configure` followed by either `export AWS_PROFILE={aws cli profilename}` on Linux/macOS or `set AWS_PROFILE={aws cli profilename}` on Windows, where `{aws cli profilename}=default` if you have not configured additional profiles
6. Run `cdk bootstrap`
7. Create a cdk.context.json file with an `ENV` key:
   - <b>Deploy to sandbox?</b> Give `ENV` any value you want, but it has to be unique, so you might get a conflict if it already exists on AWS
   - <b>Deploy to dev or prod?</b> The `ENV` value must be `dev` or `prod`. You also need to add an `AZURE` key (Azure AD metadata url)
   ```
   {
      "ENV": "exampleenv"
   }
   ```
8. Run `npm run deploy` followed by `npm run codegen` (Alternatively, go to root directory and run `./deploybackend.sh full`)
9. Run `cd ../frontend` followed by `npm start`

### After Setup:

- Run `./deploybackend.sh` to deploy changes to the backend
- Run `npm start` in frontend folder to run frontend locally
- For testing purposes, you can add data to your sandbox by running custom scripts such as `scripts/create_test_data.py`

### Production deployment instructions can be found [here](<https://github.com/knowit/Dataplattform-issues/wiki/Kompetansekartlegging:-Deployment-Guide-(CDK)>)

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `npm run lint` run ESLint and Prettier check
- `npm run lint-fix` fix auto-fixable lint and formatting errors
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

## Special packages used:

- Appsync Transformer for CDK: https://github.com/kcwinner/cdk-appsync-transformer
- Codegen inspiration: https://github.com/kcwinner/advocacy/tree/master/cdk-amplify-appsync-helpers

## CI/CD

### Deployment

GitHub Actions is configured to deploy the app to the AWS dev environment on every PR merge. This will be skipped if there are only changes to certain files like readmes, and are specified in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

Additionally, deployment can be triggered through the dispatchable workflow "`Deploy to AWS`", where you specify which environment to deploy to, and whether to deploy the entire app or the backend only.

### Linting & Code formatting

ESLint and Prettier is configured for the frontend code using recommended rules. GitHub Actions analyzes the code when PRs towards the main branch are opened.

### Slack Notifications

When deploying to both the dev and production environments, a bot will post to a channel using [Slack Apps](https://api.slack.com/) and the [Slack Notify](https://github.com/rtCamp/action-slack-notify) action.
