# kompetansekartlegging-app

This is an internal project for Knowit. The project aims
to create a tool to gauge the employees' skills and motivations
through a web form, and to make the analyses based on the form
available for the individual employees and managers.

## Dependencies

This project requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
All custom scripts are written in bash script.


## Running the project

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the GitHub repo.
2. Run `$ cd kompetansekartlegging-app` (or whatever you've chosen to
   name the project in the cloning process).
3. Run `$ ./install.sh`
4. Run `cd cdk`
6. Create a cdk.context.json file

   1. Add ENV to it. If you are deploying to a sandbox account, you can give it any value you want. These have to be unique, so you might get a conflict if it already exists on AWS. IF YOU ARE DEPLOYING TO PROD OR DEVELOPMENT the ENV value should be `prod` or `dev`. \
   2. IF DEPLOYING TO PROD OR DEVELOPMENT: Add GOOGLE_ID, GOOGLE_SECRET and AZURE to it, where GOOGLE_ID is the GCP App Id, GOOGLE_SECRET is the GCP App secret key, and AZURE is the Azure AD metadata url
7. Run `export AWS_PROFILE={aws cli profilename}` followed by `npm run deploy` and `npm run codegen` (Alternatively, go to root directory and run `./deploybackend.sh full`)
8. Change directory to frontend and run `npm start`


## Deploying CDK backend

To deploy the CDK backend you need to:
1. Clone the GitHub repo.
2. Run `$ cd kompetansekartlegging-app/cdk`
3. Run `$ npm install` in base folder (kompetansekartlegging-app/cdk). 
   Then, in the backend folder, run `npm install` in the src folders for each function, and run `npm install` in the presignup trigger.
4. Run `cdk bootstrap` in base folder (can skip if your AWS account has already done cdk bootstrap in other project)
5. Run `npm run deploy` (This command first does `cdk deploy` followed by executing the hooks/hooks.ts script)
6. Run `npm run codegen`

### After Setup:
* Run `./deploybackend.sh` to deploy changes to the backend
* Run `npm start` in frontend folder to run frontend locally

### Production deployment instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/knowit/Dataplattform-issues/wiki/Kompetansekartlegging:-Deployment-Guide-(CDK))

## Running cypress tests
1. Run `cd frontend`
2. Run `npm start` (if it is not running)
3. Open new terminal window and run `cd frontend`. Then run `npx cypress run`, tests will run in the terminal. 

## GitHub Actions
Every time you create a pull request, cypress tests will run automatically. Cypress saves screenshots if any of tests feil. You can find screenshots in workflow, in the Artifacts. 
NB! It takes ca 25 min to run them in GHA, while local running takes only 4-5 min. 



## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
