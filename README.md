# kompetansekartlegging-app

This is an internal project for Knowit. The project aims
to create a tool to gauge the employees' skills and motivations
through a web form, and to make the analyses based on the form
available for the individual employees and managers.

## Dependencies

This project requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). It also requires that [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install) are installed.
All custom scripts are written in bash script.


## Using AWS CLI SSO profiles
To use an AWS CLI sso profile, you need to run the sync_sso.py script before running our npm commands for deploying the backend. This script requires you to have boto3 installed on the python environment you use.
`python sync_sso.py awscliprofilename` is the full command you need to run. This creates temporary credentials for the SSO profile, allowing npm run deploy to use those to perform calls to AWS.

## Running the project

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the GitHub repo.
2. Run `$ cd kompetansekartlegging-app` (or whatever you've chosen to
   name the project in the cloning process).
3. Run `$ ./install.sh`
4. Run `cd cdk` \
   a. If you are using aws sso profiles you need to run `python sync_sso.py aws-cli-profile` after step 4
5. Run `export AWS_PROFILE={aws cli profilename}` followed by `cdk bootstrap`
6. Create a `cdk.context.json` file 
   * Add ENV to it. If you are deploying to a sandbox account, you can give it any value you want. These have to be unique, so you might get a conflict if it already exists on AWS. IF YOU ARE DEPLOYING TO PROD OR DEVELOPMENT the ENV value should be `prod` or `dev`.
   * IF DEPLOYING TO PROD OR DEVELOPMENT: Add GOOGLE_ID, GOOGLE_SECRET and AZURE to it, where GOOGLE_ID is the GCP App Id, GOOGLE_SECRET is the GCP App secret key, and AZURE is the Azure AD metadata url
```
   {
      "ENV": "exampleenv"
   }
```
7. Run `npm run deploy` and `npm run codegen` (Alternatively, go to root directory and run `./deploybackend.sh full`). For most `{aws cli profilename}=default` if you have not configured additional aws cli profiles.
8. Change directory to `../frontend` and run `npm start`


### After Setup:
* Run `./deploybackend.sh` to deploy changes to the backend
* Run `npm start` in frontend folder to run frontend locally

### Production deployment instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/knowit/Dataplattform-issues/wiki/Kompetansekartlegging:-Deployment-Guide-(CDK))

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template

## Special packages used:
* Appsync Transformer for CDK: https://github.com/kcwinner/cdk-appsync-transformer
* Codegen inspiration: https://github.com/kcwinner/advocacy/tree/master/cdk-amplify-appsync-helpers
